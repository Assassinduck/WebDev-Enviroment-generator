# WebDev-Enviroment-generator
A python script that lets the user generate an boilerplate html file, a normalization css file and  and js file, all with custom names and paths.
This allows for a quick start if you just wana prototype or if you are starting out on a bigger project.

This little python script is something i made after I sat down to make a new web project one night.
I realized that i felt like the process of setting up a web development enviroment was kinda boring and monotonous, and
I felt like i could automate it and remove that barrier to practice or to prototyping.

This script is still being updated, as i want to keep expanding it to include support for right-click context-menu support out of the
box and other quality of life things for the lazy dev in us all.


## Some things i want to add:

- Support for creating projects with linting configs pre-grenerated.

- Support for creating projects With frameworks.

- Other things i probably havent thought about yet.
