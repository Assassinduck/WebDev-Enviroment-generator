# WebDev-Enviroment-generator
A python script that lets the user generate an boilerplate html file, a normalization css file and  and js file, all with custom names and paths.
This allows for a quick start if you just wana prototype or if you are starting out on a bigger project.

This little python script is something i made after I sat down to make a new web project one night.
I realized that i felt like the process of setting up a web development enviroment was kinda boring and monotonous, and
I felt like i could automate it and remove that barrier to practice or to prototyping.

This script is still being updated, as i want to keep expanding it to include support for right-click context-menu support out of the
box and other quality of life things for the lazy dev in us all.


## Some things i want to add:

- Support for creating projects with linting configs pre-grenerated.

- Support for creating projects with frameworks (React, Vue, etc..).

- Other things i probably havent thought about yet.

## Features currently done

- Supports custom names for all files based on user-input.

- Supports dynamic linking based on the file names when created.

- Creating HTML5 file with boilerplate skeleton

- Creating one empty CSS3 file and one CSS3 file that normalizes the DOM (Credit to: https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)

- Creating Js file.

- Automatically opening VS Code where the files are generated.

## Features in early prototyping
- Rudementary file downloading works for one picture. Need to find out where and what to download for each framework.
